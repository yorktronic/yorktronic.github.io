Oh, hello there. It's been a while. 

I decided to spend much of this winter working at a ski shop because, well, I love skiing. A lot. This job inspired me to develop a machine-learning-based ski recommender for the 2016 / 2017 ski season. This project is very much in the infancy stage, but I thought it would be fun to mention none the less. 

Additionally, I'm working on an algorithm for automated "medium frequency" bitcoin trades, the code for which I can't really share at this time because, well, it's how I'm going to make some money. 

Finally, I'm teaming up with some data science buddies to work on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/march-machine-learning-mania-2016" target="_blank">Kaggle's Machine Learning Mania 2016.</a>

More to come.
