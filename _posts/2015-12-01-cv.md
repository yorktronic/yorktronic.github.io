title: Cross Validation of my Lending Club model
---

Several months ago, one of my assignments was to perform a multivariate analysis of Lending Club data to see if I could come up with a model that would accurately predict the interest rate offered to a potential lendee, given several indicators such as FICO score, home ownership, term leangth of the loan, loan amount, etc. 

I recently revisited this assignment as part of learning about how to perform cross validation in Python, and in doing so I was able to increase the performance of my model slightly, from an R2 of 0.657 to 0.689. <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/data_science/tree/master/thinkful/Unit4/cv" target="_blank">My analysis</a> is up on my GitHub if you'd like to check it out, but the TL:DR version is that the most reliable indicators for an interest rate offered by Lending Club are FICO score and the term length of the loan.
