title: Can you get a loan from Lending Club?
---

I was updating my LinkedIn profile today and discovered an old script that I wrote which
takes in a user's desired maximum interest rate, FICO score, and desired loan amount to predict
the probability that they will get a loan from Lending Club. The data used for this analysis
is about a year old, since Lending Club doesn't provide up-to-date data on the loans they
offered to their customers, but I think it's still handy.

Script and write-up can be found <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/data_science/tree/master/thinkful/Unit2/logistic_regression" target="_blank">here</a>.
