title: Hello, my name is Ty and this is my blog.

Well, I'm back from the honeymoon and back at work on my data science coursework. A little background on me: I'm an industrial engineer by education and recently quit my job as a business consultant / data analyst type person to pursue a career in data science. With my background in probability and statistics, and my love for programming, data science is kind of a natural leap / career change.

I'm currently enrolled in the data science program at <a href="https://thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful.com</a>, and I'm about halfway through the course as of this post. Anyway, that's enough for now, back to work.
