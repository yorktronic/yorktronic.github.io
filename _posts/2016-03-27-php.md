title: Are you down with PHP?
---

It's amazing how quickly I can forget certain syntax and attributes of languages, and then even more amazing how quickly they come back to me. That said, I'm having to revisit an old friend of mine, PHP, which I haven't used since approximately 2003 for the discussion board of a website I ran at the time.

Coming from Python, Ruby, and Javascript over the past year and a half or so, I'm realizing how easy people learning to code these days have it. It's a wonderful thing, really, that so many people from so many walks of life can learn to code. It's hard to imagine the people I see around SF who are programmers all starting out with Java, C, and PHP. 

Anyway, I guess I'm feeling old, and also fuzzy in the brain from staring at PHP all day. It's super powerful, though, which is awesome.
