title: for meat in meats
---

Yes, the post title is a little weird but just bear with me! I got married in late September and since money was tight for the wedding, I ended up writing a python script that helped to order exactly the correct amount of entrees. In the process of doing so I created what is probably the most humorous {% highlight python %}for{% endhighlight %} loop I'll ever create:

{% highlight python %}
for meat in meats:
{% endhighlight %}

Anyway, it's a simple little script but maybe it will be useful for people. If not, hopefully it's funny that I did this.

Hopefully!
