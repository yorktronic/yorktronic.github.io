Well, hello there. My name is Ty, and I'm either a data scientist or I'm almost a data scientist. My old job was a business consultant and analyst of sorts, helping to make a federal government agency more efficient by better leveraging technology such as Salesforce CRM, and through business process improvement and analysis, among other things. 

In January of 2015 I decided I wanted to be a web developer, so I taught myself Ruby, and subsequently decided I did not want to be a web developer (no offense to Ruby). In May of 2015, I decided I wanted to be a data scientist, which kind of makes sense because I studied industrial engineering in college and thus have a decent background in statistics, optimization, linear and discrete mathematics, etc. So, I taught myself python, pandas, numPy, statsmodels, and am in the progress of learning the power of Dato's (formerly GraphLab's) SFrame and  visualization tools such as <a href="http://d3js.org/" target="_blank">D3<a>,  <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">bokeh</a>, and <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">highcharts</a>.

I have since left my day job as an industrial engineer to pursue data science full time, because that's how much I love it. Some of my projects include a recommendation engine for <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/hots-comp-calc" target="_blank">building a team in Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm</a> (still very much a work in progress), and I've done <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/data_science">a ton of work</a> for Thinkful.com's data science course. I'm also enrolled in Coursera's Machine Learning specialization.
