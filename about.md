### About yorktronic.io

Well, hello there. My name is Ty, and the sole purpose of this page is for me to talk about my experiences learning data science. In January of 2015 I decided I wanted to be a web developer, so I taught myself Ruby, and subsequently decided I did not want to be a web developer (no offense to Ruby). In May of 2015, I decided I wanted to be a data scientist, which kind of makes sense because I studied industrial engineering in college and thus have a decent background in statistics, optimization, linear and discrete mathematics, etc.

I am currently working on a couple of projects, including a recommendation engine for building a team in Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm, a video game. More to come!
