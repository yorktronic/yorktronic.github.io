My name is Ty, and I'm a data scientist with a focus on recommendation systems. In my old job
I was a business consultant, analyst, industrial engineer, and developer of sorts, helping to
make a the <a href="https://www.gsa.gov">United States General Services Administration</a>
more efficient by better leveraging technology such as Salesforce CRM, and through business
process improvement and analysis, among other things. I also used statistics and optimization
towards the same goal.

I have since left that job to pursue data science, cryptocurrency, and software engineering full time, and a list of some of the projects I've worked on can be found on the <a href="../projects/">projects page</a>. I have completed both Thinkful.com's data science program, as well as Coursera's Machine Learning Foundations program, and am currently working toward completing Coursera's machine learning specialization.
