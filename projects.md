For now, please check out the list of projects I have in the <a href="https://github.com/yorktronic/data_science" target="_blank">data-science repo</a> of my GitHub.

Also, I built the <a href="http://sffeb.us" target="_blank">San Francisco Federal Executive Board website</a> in 60 days, back when I worked for Uncle Sam. I no longer run the site so if there's anything bad about it, it's not my fault :)
